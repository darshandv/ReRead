New Beginnings - NITK Basketball 2018-19.


It's been roughly 2 months since college re-opened, and with the rains now receding, the NITK Basketball team is slowly getting into its groove. What began with frustration at not being able to use the court for high intensity workouts has now turned into determination to do well on the court, as well as have fun while playing the sport. Rather than stagnate, and complain about the rain, the first month was utilised to work on physical conditioning, so as to be in shape when the tournaments come calling. During August, NITK Basketball(Men and Women) played practice matches against NMAMIT, Nitte, with the matches taking place on a beautiful wooden court in their backyard.

Come September, and the first real test awaited the team as they participated in the Annual Naismith Memorial Tournament held in Mangalore. Despite putting up a spirited fight, the men's team went down fighting in the semi finals against Nitte Degree College. It's safe to say that the loss has only motivated us further to improve our game and bounce back stronger in time for the tournament to be held in Yenepoya in the first week of October. 

More to come, 
NITK Basketball.
