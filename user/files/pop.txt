Population refers to the number of people living in a particular area. The study of a population in terms of statistics pertaining to its size, composition and other parameters such as birth rate, death rate, growth rate as also ageing is known as demography. The size of a countryâ€™s population influences its social and economic condition.

Population density is a parameter derived by dividing the population figure of a place by its area. A place with a smaller area would have a higher population density than one with a larger area if the population in the two places are equal.
